Flicker ;Perceptible on lower refresh rates (60Hz and below) ;Depends, in 2013 most LCDs used PWM (strobing) to dim the backlightExplanation of why pulse width modulated backlighting is used, and its side-effects, "Pulse Width Modulation on LCD monitors", TFT Central. Retrieved June 2012. However, since then many flicker free LCD computer monitors were introduced. Flicker Free Monitor Database on tftcentral.co.uk ;Does not normally occur due to high refresh rate.How Do Plasma TVs Create No Flicker? ;Does not normally occur at 100% brightness level. At levels below 100% flicker often occurs with frequencies between 60 and 255hz, since often pulse-width modulation is used to dim OLED screens.

For the majority of images it will consume 60–80% of the power of an LCD.  OLED displays use 40% of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black as they lack the need for a backlight, while OLED can use more than three times as much power to display a mostly white image compared to an LCD.

Other ;No native resolution. Currently, the only display technology capable of multi-syncing (displaying different resolutions and refresh rates without the need for scaling).Native Resolution - AfterDawn: Glossary of technology terms & acronyms Display lag is extremely low due to its nature, which does not have the ability to store image data before output, unlike LCDs, plasma displays and OLED displays. Extremely bulky and heavy construction in comparison to other display technologies. Large displays would be unsuitable for wall mounting. New models are no longer produced. ;The LCD grid can mask effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality.  M. d'Zmura, T. P.

Is the cheapest display technology currently produced, with some entry-level models selling for less than $100.  ;Screen-door effects are more noticeable than LCD when up close, or on larger sizes.  New models are no longer produced. ;Coloured sub-pixels may age at different rates, leading to a colour shift. Sensitive to UV light from direct sunlight. Is considered the highest quality but also the most expensive display technology currently produced, with products rarely being available for less than $1000.
