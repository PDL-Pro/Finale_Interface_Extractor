 ; DeveloperThe developer is the company or individual that has produced/created the game. ; First releaseThe first release is the commercial release within the video game franchise that is earliest in time. ; Latest releaseThe latest release is the commercial release within the video game franchise that is most recent in time. This may be the latest version if there is only one game in the series or the latest sequel if there are multiple games in the series. ; Panels/padThe number of panels per pad refers to the number of inputs that are utilized in gameplay after the start of a song/level. ; ModifiersModifiers are changes that can be made to modify the game's step routine that usually either increase or decrease difficulty. Such changes may consist of modifications to note scrolling speed, changes to the design or integrity of the notes, and alterations to note positioning. ; CoursesCourses, often termed "Marathon courses," are sets of multiple songs that are played back-to-back without intermediate rests for the player to select the next song. During course play, life meters for subsequent songs are often directly impacted by the life meters from the songs previously completed. Thus the second song in a course set may begin with the same life meter as the player remained with at the completion of the first song in the course. Courses are often constructed thematically. ; BombsBombs are notes that scroll onto the screen along with the note-markers that the player must avoid stepping on. Often, stepping on a bomb penalizes the player's dance gauge by having it reduced. In some games, derivative elements called "Attack Mines" or "Mod Bombs" may be used to trigger changes to the gameplay that the player might find distracting. ; USB CardUSB card availability refers to the capacity of video game systems in the series (typically arcade systems) to read character or song data from an external removable USB drive.
