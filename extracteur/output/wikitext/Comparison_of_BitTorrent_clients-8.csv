 BitTorrent library ; Super-seeding ; Tracker ; UPnP Automatically configure port forwarding (requires Router with UPnP support) ; NAT Port Mapping Protocol ; NAT traversal Many clients claim to support this, but just UPnP calls for opening a TCP port is not effective and disabled by factory default in most new hardware. "UDP NAT Traversal" is the proper working solution, supported by just a few. ; DHT DHT permits use of trackerless torrents (with supporting clients) to resume normal torrents when their tracker is down. However, some trackers that register their users for keeping tabs on fair usage (such as a ratio of bytes downloaded to uploaded) may not reliably measure and update usage for users employing DHT. ; Peer exchange ; Encryption ; UDP tracker ; LPD ; Fast extensions ; Magnet URI ; μTP
