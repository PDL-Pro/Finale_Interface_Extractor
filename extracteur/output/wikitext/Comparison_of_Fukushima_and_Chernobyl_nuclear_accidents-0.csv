 Cause of the accident ; Proximate cause was human error and violation of procedures. The unsafe reactor design caused instability at low power due to a positive void coefficient and steam formation. When an improper test was conducted at 1:00 am at low power, the reactor became prompt critical. This was followed by a steam explosion that exposed the fuel, a raging fire, and a core meltdown. The fire lasted for days to weeks, and there is controversy over whether it was the fuel burning, nuclear decay heating or whether the graphite moderator that made up most of the core was involved.  See Chernobyl Disaster, Note 1, for more discussion. ; The plants were not designed with consideration of such a large tsunami. Subsequent review did not lead to mitigation. A major earthquake and tsunami caused the destruction of power lines and backup generators. Once the plants were without external power and the generators were flooded, a catastrophic decay heat casualty ensued, leading to major reactor plant damage including meltdown and explosive loss of reactor containment. 
 Maximum level of radiation detected ; 300 Sv/h shortly after the explosion in vicinity of the reactor core. ; 530 Sv/h inside Unit 2 containment vessel in 2017 according to Japan Times.date = 2017-02-03

 Current status ; All reactors were shut down by 2000. The damaged reactor was covered by a hastily built steel and concrete structure called the sarcophagus. A New Safe Confinement structure was installed in November 2016, from which the plant will be cleaned up and decommissioned. ; Cold shutdown declared on 16 December 2011, but decommissioning is likely to take 30 to 40 years.date=7 April 2011accessdate=10 March 2014 All fuel rods in reactor 4 pool removed. Fukushima disaster cleanup is ongoing.
