Universal Flash Storage Card Extensions ;Samsung ;UFS Card ;2016 ;>256GB ; ;Packages the flash memory, currently soldered in shipping smartphones, into a removable card form factor.  Uses the SCSI command set including queuing. The electrical interface makes use of differential signaling, which enables high bus speeds and robustness under noisy conditions and reduced pin count (compared to parallel bus alternatives such as UHS-I).
