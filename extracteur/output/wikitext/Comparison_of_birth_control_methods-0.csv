 2002 cervical cap and spermicide (discontinued in 2008) used by parous displayauthors = 8 In the effectiveness study of Lea's Shield, 84% of participants were parous.  The unadjusted pregnancy rate in the six-month study was 8.7% among spermicide users and 12.9% among non-spermicide users.  No pregnancies occurred among nulliparous users of the Lea's Shield.  Assuming the effectiveness ratio of nulliparous to parous users is the same for the Lea's Shield as for the Prentif cervical cap and the Today contraceptive sponge, the unadjusted six-month pregnancy rate would be 2.2% for spermicide users and 2.9% for those who used the device without spermicide.  ; Lea's Shield ; 15 (1 of 6) ; no data ; Barrier + spermicide ; Vaginal insertion ;  Every act of intercourse ;$0 - $ ;$0 - $

 Symptoms-based fertility awareness ex. symptothermal and calendar-based methodsNo formal studies meet the standards of Contraceptive Technology for determining typical effectiveness. The typical effectiveness listed here is from the CDC's National Survey of Family Growth, which grouped symptoms-based methods together with calendar-based methods. See Fertility awareness#Effectiveness.The term fertility awareness is sometimes used interchangeably with the term natural family planning (NFP), though NFP usually refers to use of periodic abstinence in accordance with Catholic beliefs. ; TwoDay method, Billings ovulation method, Creighton Model ; 24  (1 of 4) ; 34 ; Behavioral ; Observation and charting of basal body temperature, cervical mucus or cervical position  ; ; Throughout day or dailyUsers may observe one of the three primary fertility signs.

 Placebo doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(69)90142-2  ; ; 100Several factors may contribute to the fact that the placebo was observed to be significantly less effective than unprotected intercourse: 1. The study was not representative, as it only considered women of low socioeconomic level who had aborted spontaneously and desired pregnancy, 2. the placebo may have caused behavioral differences compared to unprotected intercourse: the couples might assume to be protected and thus be less reluctant to have sex and/or be in a different psychological mood that increases fertility via psychosomatic action (all, after about half a year) ; 100 ; Placebo ; Oral medication ;  Daily ;$0 - $ ;$0 - $
