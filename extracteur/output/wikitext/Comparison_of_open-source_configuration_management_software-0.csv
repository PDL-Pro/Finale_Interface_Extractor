 rh| Local ConFiGuration system (LCFG) ; Perl ; GPL ; partialLCFG does not provide its own transport mechanism, it relies on an external program, most often Apache. Using Apache it should be possible to do mutual authentication in several ways, however the documentation at The Complete Guide to LCFG, Section 9.4: Authorization and Security, shows access control based on IP address ranges, implying that the client does not authenticate itself to the server via an SSL certificate, it also does not mention if the LCFG client checks the validity of the server's SSL certificate (such as via a per-site fingerprint distributed with the client, or a chain of trust to an accredited CA). It mentions that there can be a per-client password in the profile, but also states that "The contents of the LCFG profile should be considered public". ; partialLCFG supports encrypted communications channels (SSL via Apache), however the documentation at The Complete Guide to LCFG, Section 9.4: Authorization and Security, states that "The contents of the LCFG profile should be considered public". ; no ; no ; no ;1994 ;Weekly Releases
